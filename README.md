# Auditory Feedback System for Visually Impaired Programmers

## 📘 Introduction

This project provides an **auditory feedback system** designed to assist **visually impaired individuals learning to program**. Using **real-time sonification**, the system translates essential programming concepts—such as syntax errors, indentation, and code execution—into **auditory cues**. The goal is to enhance code comprehension, reduce cognitive load, and promote inclusive learning environments in computer science education.

## 🎯 Key Features

* 🔍 **Real-time Error Detection**
  Identifies syntax errors as they occur and uses distinct sound cues for different error types.

* 📐 **Indentation Tracking**
  Represents indentation depth using pitch modulation—**deeper indentation = lower pitch**.

* 🔁 **Loop Iteration Feedback**
  Emits rhythmic ticking sounds for each loop iteration, helping users track iteration progress.

* 🎶 **Function Execution Sounds**
  Plays chimes for function calls and distinct tones for successful completions.

* 🎛️ **Customizable Sound Profiles**
  Allows users to tailor feedback tones to personal preferences or hearing sensitivities.

* 🧠 **Adaptive Feedback**
  Automatically adjusts the level of detail in feedback based on the user's programming proficiency. Beginners receive more granular audio cues.

* 🤝 **Optional Tactile Feedback**
  Supports integration with wearable devices for **critical alerts** via vibration or haptic feedback.

## 👥 Target Users

* **Primary Users**
  Visually impaired individuals learning to program, especially in languages like **Python**.

* **Secondary Users**
  Researchers and developers in the fields of **assistive technology**, **accessible computing**, and **human-computer interaction**.
